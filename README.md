The object I set out to do was to use terraform to easily deploy infrastructure into Azure using Azure CLI

***

#### Installing Terraform

Windows Version 1903 (OS Build 18342.8)

Download terraform from Terraform website for the required platform. In my case Windows. Create directory C:\Windows\Program Files\terraform copy the terraform.exe into the folder



```
test
```
